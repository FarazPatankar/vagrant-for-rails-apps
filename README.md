# Rails-Heroku Development Environment on Vagrant

Configuration files to automatically set up a basic and customizable Vagrant box
with the required tools to develop Rails projects oriented to be deployed over
the [Heroku][10] platform.


## Usage

0.- Install in your computer the software listed the prerequisites section.
1.- Clone the repository into your machine.
2.- Tweak the provider and options in the `Vagrantfile`.
3.- Run `vagrant up` and wait for the machine to be built.
4.- When the machine is ready, run `vagrant ssh` and `cd /vagrant`.
5.- ...


## Prerequisites

* [Vagrant][0]
* [Virtualbox][1] and the extension pack.

If you experience notice that delays on the synchronization of shared folders,
a better option is to use [SSHF][2] or [NFS][3].


## Included Software

* **[Ubuntu Xenial][4]** (with Development Tools): This Linux distribution is
  closer to the one used on the Heroku-16 stack.

* **Ruby 2.3 (with [RVM][5])**: Programming language that supports the Rails
  framework. The Ruby Version Manager allows to easily use different Ruby
  versions and gems per project.

* **[Node.js][6]**: Server side JavaScript runtime.

* **[Postgres][7]**: Advanced SQL database.

* **[Redis][8]**: In-memory data structure store.

* **[Heroku CLI][9]**: Tool for creating and managing Heroku apps from the
  the command line.
