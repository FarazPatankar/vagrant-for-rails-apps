# Rails-Heroku Development Environment on Vagrant

Configuration files to automatically set up a basic and customizable Vagrant box
with the required tools to develop Rails projects oriented to be deployed over
the [Heroku][10].

Therefore, the software versions installed try to match those supported on the
Heroku platform.


## Usage

0. Install in your computer the software listed the prerequisites section.
1. Clone the repository into your machine.
2. Tweak the provider and options in the `Vagrantfile`.
3. Run `vagrant up` and wait for the machine to be built.
4. When the machine is ready, run `vagrant ssh` and `cd /vagrant`.
5. You may now start a new Rails project with `rails new .` or adjust the Ruby
   and gems settings with RVM to match an existent code base.


## Prerequisites

* [Vagrant][0]
* [Virtualbox][1] and the extension pack.

If you experience notice that delays on the synchronization of shared folders,
a better option is to use [SSHF][2] or [NFS][3].


## Out of the Box Included Software

* **[Ubuntu Xenial][4]**: This Linux distribution is closer to the one used on
  the Heroku-16 stack.

* **Ruby 2.4.x (with [RVM][5])**: Programming language that supports the Rails
  framework. The Ruby Version Manager allows to easily use different Ruby
  versions and gems per project.

* **[Rails 5.1.x][11]**: And other gems to aid the development of web apps.

* **[Node.js 8.2.x][6]**: Server side JavaScript runtime.

* **[Postgres 9.5][7]**: Advanced SQL database.

* **[Redis 3.0.x][8]**: In-memory data structure store.

* **[Heroku CLI][9]**: Tool for creating and managing Heroku apps from the
  the command line.

* **ZSH Shell (With Oh-My-Zsh!)**
